# Retro Dave (Previously 10/5)

Retro Dave is a hardcore platformer programmed in lua using the Love2d framework. 
It features 47 challenges spread out over 14 separate levels. On each level the player is given 10 lives, lose thee lives and it is game over.

It runs on both PC, Mac, Linux and Android using Love2d.
Once completed it will be downloadable from Google Play for Android and the Appstore for iOS.

To play the game download Love2d and run the .love file. Feedback is appriciated, however this is still very much a work in progress.
